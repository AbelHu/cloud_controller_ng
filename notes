today:
1. change shared domain model to get router_group_type from the routing api
2. move route validations to the route model (no need to pass routing api client since a route can ask a domain if it's a tcp domain)
3. ship it




RoutesController#create
Request goes to the controller
Route.create_from_hash(params)


validations

- RouteValidator (model)
  - Talk to apiclient to get the route group
  - Validate using all the rules
  - return true or false

- Model validations (that we already have)

- Save

- Return back to controller
